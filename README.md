# D3 Homework - Data Journalism and D3
We were tasked with creating a scater plot between two data varriables in the data.csv file utilzign the d3.csv function. 
Utilizing the smoking % and the age as my x and y coordinates, and the abbreviations as my text, the scatter plot was combined and stitched together for this visualization. 
This visualization was then hosted on a simple HTML page.
